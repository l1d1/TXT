<h1>Devil by the Window <br>(자정의 창가에서 만난 악마의 목소리는 달콤했다)</h1>

<p>Lie, li-li-lie down, go rest your eyes
<br>Just fall asleep, sweet dreams, you can't get off the ride
<br>A wolf in sheep clothes, his disguise
<br>In the ni-ni-ni-night, you'll be hiding inside
<br><br>Oh, what you doing?
<br>You got some time today?
<br>Oh, what a nuisance
<br>Come, come, come out to play
<br><br>High, so high, the crimson sky
<br>It's way too sweet to turn down
<br>I scream and shout, but no one's 'round
<br>There's no way to escape it
<br><br>I met the devil by the window, traded my life
<br>Temptation touched my tongue, spread the wings of desire
<br>He's whispering, "Give up, don't you put up a fight"
<br>Said the devil by the window, "Dream on, dream on, good night"
<br><br>Uh-uh-uh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
<br>Uh-uh-uh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
<br>Uh-uh-uh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
<br>Said the devil by the window, "Dream on, dream on, good night"
<br><br>Waste, waste away in the gutter with me
<br>No, I can't tell what is fake in my reality
<br>I see the waves, see the waves wash over me
<br>Oh, stay, you can stay when you're tempted to leave
<br><br>Oh, what you doing?
<br>You got some time today?
<br>Oh, what a nuisance
<br>Come, come, come out to play
<br><br>High, so high, the crimson sky
<br>It's way too sweet to turn down
<br>I scream and shout, but no one's 'round
<br>There's no way to escape it
<br><br>I met the devil by the window, traded my life
<br>Temptation touched my tongue, spread the wings of desire
<br>He's whispering, "Give up, don't you put up a fight"
<br>Said the devil by the window, "Dream on, dream on, good night"
<br><br>Uh-uh-uh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
<br>Uh-uh-uh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
<br>Uh-uh-uh, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah
<br>Said the devil by the window, "Dream on, dream on, good night"
<br><br>Devil, de-devil, devil
<br>Devil, de-devil (oh, I met the-)
<br>Devil, de-devil, devil (oh-oh-oh)
<br>Come here, come here, good night
<br><br>High, high, high, I feel my body drifting into the sky
<br>I won't come down, come down, come down
<br>I'll fly weightless without a worry into the night
<br>He said, "Dream on, dream on, dream on"</p>
